# KPA to LFSR based generator

Educational Jupyter notebook focused on **stream ciphers** and **Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR)**, showing how a **Known Plaintext Attack (KPA)** can be used to recover the internal state of an LFSR-based cipher.

## Overview
- Stream cipher basics
- LFSR structure and keystream generation
- Known Plaintext Attack methodology
- Practical examples and experiments
